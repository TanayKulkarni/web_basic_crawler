This is a Basic web crawler script made using python.
The python library used in this is Beautifulsoup.
You can also do something similar using scrapy.
The basic idea behind this script is that you scrape the result from google search for top rated places near any town or sub-town.
Also the ratings for these places are scraped along with the places.
Remember the basis of scraping is using the class id's or names of a particular tag as we take the data from an HTML code.
There are two files provided here, one is a python file while the other is a jupyter notebook.
Jupyter notebook is recommended for running all python related files.
